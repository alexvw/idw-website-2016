				<h2>What is the AXN?</h2>
                <h4>The AXN transforms the challenge of identity into an opportunity for growth.</h4>
				<br>

				<ul>
				<li>Reduce identity verification costs and generate revenue</li>
				<li>Transform your business using federation</li>

				<h3>Digital identity is a challenge for everyone who touches the internet. </h3><br>
				<p>We all create usernames and passwords for tens or hundreds of websites, providing personal 
				information and trust it will all be kept safe. 
				</p><br>	<p>But the reality is much different, sites are 
				hacked; personal and corporate information is constantly stolen and trust is diminished.

				ID Dataweb works behind the scene providing identity infrastructure that transforms the way companies, 
				associations and agencies work together more securely while enhancing privacy. IDW has easy install APIs
				to help you quickly improve identity validation, implement identity proofing and create trust across corporate value chains.
				</p>
				<br><h4>Reduce Identity Verification Costs and Produce Revenue</h4>
				<ul><li>IDW has entered into agreements with all the leading credit bureaus and other international 
				identity verification services.  As a wholesale provider of services, 
				IDW is able to reduce service deployment time and cost.
				</ul>
				<br><p>
				One of the first challenges with digital identity is to know who is on the other end of the 
				connection while creating an account. Quite often, we create a relationship with a person without 
				the ability to have  face-to-face confirmation of their identity. This spans across industries including;  
				banking, healthcare, employers, government agencies and retailers. Once an account relationship is created, 
				we want confidence that the same person is logging in. IDW supports this capability on the exchange.
				</p>
				<p>IDW has entered into agreements to verify identity from a variety of trusted service providers. 
				This creates a competitive marketplace for you to purchase identity services. Equally important, one 
				agreement with IDW gives you access to IDW’s partners. IDW buys wholesale and passes savings onto its customers.

				<h3>Generate Revenue with Enterprise Credentials</h3>
				<p>For companies who have verified employee credentials, they may wish to monetize these credentials 
				for login to partner web services through the exchange. For example, companies verify employee identity 
				information to create a credential during the hire process including verifying an employee’s driver’s 
				license/passport, SSN and other information.
				</p>
				<p>The same credential login and verified attributes can be monetized when the employee uses their corporate 
				credential to login via the AXN to other companies. The AXN blinding process will keep the requesting company’s
				information secure and only requests information if the information provided does not match what is available 
				through other verification methods.  The digital response is a yes or no. 
				</p>
				<p>
				IDW uses an API to your corporate information service through standard protocols (SAML or OAuth) to generate 
				verification claims (yes/no match responses), but does not pull information from your service. Our customers 
				make the corporate login service available and determine pricing to their corporate value chain partners/customers.
