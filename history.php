				<h3>ID/DataWeb Company History</h3>
				<p>ID Dataweb, Inc. (“IDW”), together with its affiliates, provides cybersecurity, 
				systems engineering, software development, and infrastructure support services 
				to Federal government agencies and the commercial sector.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h4>Development of the AXN</h4>
				<p>In early 2011, David Coxe and IDW partnered with Google to design and develop an 
				open-sourced software system for identity. The system would support cloud-based web 
				services to enable users to reduce the number of credentials needed to create and log 
				into accounts online. Upon completion of the Google project, IDW realized that a 
				cloud-based transaction hub would enable a powerful model for identity federation 
				and independently created such a hub, called the Attribute Exchange Network (“AXN”).
				</p><br><br>
			
			<h4>NSTIC Experience</h4>
			<p>In Q4 2012, IDW’s affiliate, Criterion Systems, was awarded and successfully executed 
			a grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) to implement 
			pilots as defined by the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (“NSTIC”). 
			As the lead subcontractor, IDW implemented pilots using AXN, an Internet-scale transaction 
			services and contractual hub for online attribute verification and credential federation 
			that can be used to enforce privacy and federated Attribute Based Access Control (“ABAC”) 
			security precepts for enhanced security and privacy. As a commercial cloud service, 
			the AXN enables Identity Providers, Attribute Providers, Relying Parties, and users to 
			securely federate and reuse credentials and attributes in a policy driver, low-risk 
			manner and at an affordable cost.</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Each NSTIC pilot was designed to support up to 50,000 live users from Relying Parties including:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>DHS National Incident Command System (First Responder authentication)</li>
			<li>Census Bureau (online surveys for verified participants) </li>
			<li>Broadridge Communications (financial communications digital delivery with Pitney Bowes)</li>
			<li>General Electric (enterprise/supply chain identity federation; ABAC for supply chain and Internet of Things initiatives).</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Current Efforts</h4>
			<p>IDW is now offering the AXN commercially in several vertical large-scale markets, including Health care.</p>
